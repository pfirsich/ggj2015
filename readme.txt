Technology
----------
Made using löve2d (https://love2d.org/) and using the libraries HardonCollider (http://vrld.github.io/HardonCollider/) and anim8 (https://github.com/kikito/anim8/). All of these are *awesome* libraries by awesome people.
Also we used http://www.bfxr.net/ for the sounds and made the music using MilkyTracker.

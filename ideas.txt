* Natural Distasters (time pressure!)
* Coop - Escapes, which require an other player collaborating (for example an other player pressing the button for the elevator, sacrificing himself maybe)
* Competitive - Ways to knock players down and stun them for a while
* Mulitplayer on one keyboard? Only interact and move buttons necessary
* Escapes only for a fixed number of players << total number of players
* Rest of the group asks the theme question! after the escape
* Different escapes for every playthrough (probabilistic)
* New levels can only be accessed, when the player survived the previous level
